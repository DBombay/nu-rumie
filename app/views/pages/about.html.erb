      it's tough out there. it's not like houses with white-picket fences
      just drop from trees, right?

      maybe you're just starting out on your own, or re-starting. perhaps home
      ownership isn't your schtick or you just love the flexibility of the renting.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      either way, you're here because you're looking for a place to live, and
      some awesome people to live with.

    <h3>how does nü rümie help me?</h3>

      simple. we connect you with people that like the same stuff you do.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      once you're signed in, simply complete our personality quiz and we'll find
      other people that are into what you're into.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      find a couple people you mesh well with, and you can form a rümie group
      with them. once you're 'rümies', you can chat with them and start looking
      for a place to move in to.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
      <strong>yeah. it's that easy.</strong>
